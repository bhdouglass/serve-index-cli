# Serve Index CLI

A simple way to serve a directory listing, similar to http-server.
This is just a small wrapper around [serve-index](https://github.com/expressjs/serve-index),
it uses serve-index for all the heavy lifting.

## Install

`npm install -g serve-index-cli`

## Basic Usage

`serve-index`

By default serve-index-cli only listens on localhost:3000 and servers the current directory.

## Extended Usage

All args are optional

`serve-index --port 3000 --ip 0.0.0.0 --dir="/path/to/awesome/files/" --icons=false --hidden=true --stylesheet="files.css" --template="index.html" --view="details"`

For more information about the options, check the [serve-index](https://github.com/expressjs/serve-index) configuration options.

serve-index-cli also supports a `--json-list` flag that will generate a list.json
that contains a list of all the files in the directory tree.
